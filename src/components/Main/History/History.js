        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The very concept of "social network" entered our lexicon only in the mid-2000s, when all the main services that we still use began to open up to the general public. The developers have found a successful format — a social network based on user profiles. Now it seems natural, but then such an architecture was only one of the options. User growth statistics have crept up, and this has convinced investors to invest a lot of money in these sites. At the same time, high-speed Internet has ceased to be a privilege. Millions of new users flooded into the network — and the first thing they did was start accounts on social networks.</p>

            <h3>Social networks that changed the world</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    2004, Facebook. Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg came up with a platform for students of his university, where they could communicate, exchange photos, change statuses. By 2008, the site had become one of the most visited in the world and today occupies the 2nd place, second only to Google. Today, 2 billion people use the social network every month.
                </li>
                <li>2006, Twitter. American programmer Jack Dorsey launches a social network in a new, revolutionary format. Users exchange short text messages that are limited to 140 characters. At the same time, all messages are publicly available to the user's subscribers.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>On the expanses of the CIS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                2006, Odnoklassniki. Social networks came to the Russian-language Internet only in 2006, and the first was Albert Popkov's platform, similar to Classmates.com . Search for classmates, classmates, friends from other cities, even relatives — here you can really restore lost connections. At the moment, the number of network users is about 300 million people.
                </li>
                <li>2006, VKontakte. The platform was originally intended by its creator Pavel Durov for university graduates. Now it is the most popular in Russia and the CIS countries. The ability to upload video and audio files was also added to personal profiles, statuses, and photo sharing, due to which the service quickly became a well-known hosting service. Currently, 380 million users are registered on the VKontakte website, 80 million of them check their pages daily.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why is it profitable</h3>
            <p>
                Social networks have long ceased to be exclusively a communication channel. Almost every company gets an official account on a particular platform, which allows you to solve a number of marketing tasks, in particular, to create PR campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is due to this that social networks are primarily monetized. They introduce targeted advertising that is targeted at a certain type of audience — according to geographical, gender, professional, age and other principles. In this way, the brand itself can configure who exactly to show its ads to — taking into account the necessary parameters. This is the most common and effective way to monetize a social network.</p>
            <h3>The catch from social networks in millions of dollars</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                The social network Facebook occupies a leading position both in terms of attendance and revenue. Over the past year, the company's net profit amounted to $ 10.2 billion. If compared with last year, the service improved its performance by 177% for net profit and by 54% for revenue!
                </li>
                <li>The revenue of the only Russian—language service in this rating, VKontakte, has grown to almost 4 billion rubles (or $ 6.9 million) over the past year. And this is 40% higher compared to last year. VKontakte, of course, is inferior to its Western colleagues, but nevertheless it is increasing momentum and showing quite a decent result.
